## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```

Once the app is fully functional in the local server, push the contents to GitHub:

```
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Update"
$ git push
```

Once all contents are pushed to GitHub, push the contents to Heroku:

```
$ git push heroku
```
